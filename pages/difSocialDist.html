    <h3>Overall Simulation</h3>
    <p>This is based off the S-I-R Model of epidemiology: more info <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology">here</a>. A person can either be S - susceptible, I - infected, or R - recovered (or more pessimistically, removed). When the simulation starts, the people are set loose to start bouncing off of each other and the walls in a confined space. Upon collision, any infected person has a chance of infecting a susceptible person, but a removed is immune to infection. In real life, the two biggest factors over death count are the peak height of the curve and the total amount of people recovered -- which is why it's so important to flatten the curve!</p>
    <h3>This Simulation</h3>
    <p>How do physical barriers between populations affect infection? This splits up a population evenly, keeping the infected people on the left. With one controllable opening to the other side, play around with how one case spreads to entire communities. Using the sliders, you can control the gap width and the height of the gap to either isolate or bring together two populations (or anything in between). This could simulate a real life travel ban and how that could easily get compromised with a couple of people slipping across. </p>
    <h3>Graph</h3>
    <p>The graph displays the percentage of Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered people over time. </p>
