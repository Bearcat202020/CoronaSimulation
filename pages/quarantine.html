    <h3>Overall Simulation</h3>
    <p>This is based off the S-I-R Model of epidemiology: more info <a target="_blank" href = "https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology">here</a>. A person can either be S - susceptible, I - infected, or R - recovered (or more pessimistically, removed). When the simulation starts, the people are set loose to start bouncing off of each other and the walls in a confined space. Upon collision, any infected person has a chance of infecting a susceptible person, but a removed is immune to infection. In real life, the two biggest factors over death count are the peak height of the curve and the total amount of people recovered -- which is why it's so important to flatten the curve!</p>
    <h3>This Simulation</h3>
    <p>What happens when people are physically quarantined after being diagnosed? What if not everyone immediately showed symptomps? See how fast acting a total quarantine solution is. (Based off of <a href = "https://youtu.be/gxAaO2rsdIs?t=366">this video</a>.) If someone is asymptomatic, they will show up as yellow and will not be quarantined (this would mimic someone in the real world continuing on with their day without showing symptoms). The other slider controls how long an infected person goes before going into quarantine (drifting to the right and going in that box).</p>
    <h3>Graph</h3>
    <p>The graph displays the percentage of Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered people over time. </p>
