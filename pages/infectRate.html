      <h3>Overall Simulation</h3>
      <p>This is based off the S-I-R Model of epidemiology: more info here and here. A person can either be S - susceptible, I - infected, or R - recovered (or more pessimistically, removed). When the simulation starts, the people are set loose to start bouncing off of each other and the walls in a confined space. Upon collision, any infected person has a chance of infecting a susceptible person, but a removed is immune to infection. In real life, the two biggest factors over death count are the peak height of the curve and the total amount of people recovered -- which is why it's so important to flatten the curve!</p>
      <h3>This Simulation</h3>
      <p>This simulation lets you alter the virus itself! Control how likely one is to get the virus from bouncing into someone else and how long someone is contagious for. This could also simulate how well a community responds to a virus (hand washing, wearing masks, coughing into shoulders, etc.. ). </p>
      <h3>Graph</h3>
      <p>The graph displays the percentage of Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered people over time. </p>
